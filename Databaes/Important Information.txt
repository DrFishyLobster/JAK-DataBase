This file includes important imformation:

1) Encoding

	Records are stored in the columns as bytes, with type info. Thus, bytes can be interpreted on the basis of
	their type and a list of columns can be cycled and treated the same.

	Strings are stored as bytes of UTF-8. They all end in a ENDOFTEXT byte (00000011)

2) Binary File Main Data Protocol

	Each Entry is stored as a series of its record parts in columns. 
	i.e.:

	if entries 1, 2 and 3 had column properties of a,b and c, it would be stored as such:


		1a 1b 1c 2a 2b 2c 3a 3b 3c
