	* I really like the yes or no verfication scheme
	* You are now able to do TheDatabase[Colnum][Recnum] instead of TheDatabase.Data[Colnum].Data[Recnum];
	* I think we will later write more for displaying database, with colour etc, but good enough building block
	* I think do... while (HappyWithCreation != "yes" && HappyWithCreation != "no") should be just 
	happywithCreation == "no";
	* I really like having to fix all the entries that don't have the column information
	* I'm not a fan of ShortformToFieldDescription and ShortformToType. There is the ability to access so much
	other types so we shouldn't be restricted to just 4 or 5. What i was thinking was something like this:

	There is already a list of available types so we could in theory display something like this:
	0. Text
	1. Byte
	2. SByte
	3. Short
	...
	11. DateTime

	They then input a number 0-11, which we can then set itype to be ArrayOfTypes[Input];

	What do you think?

		All appropriate changes have been made :)
